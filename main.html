	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures how the running time of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. It helps you understand how efficient an algorithm is, especially for large inputs.</p>
	<p>Time complexity like O(n) means the algorithmâ€™s running time grows linearly with the input size. <b>Space complexity</b> O(n) means it uses memory that also grows linearly with the input size.</p>
