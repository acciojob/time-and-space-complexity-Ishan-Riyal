	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to how the runtime of an algorithm increases with input size. It helps determine how efficient an algorithm is when handling large amounts of data.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to how much memory an algorithm uses as the input size grows. For example, if an algorithm uses memory that scales linearly with input, it's said to have space complexity of O(n).</p>
